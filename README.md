Hamster: A Personalized Virtual Assistant with Smart Task Automation 

# 🐹 Hamster — A Personal Virtual Assistant (with a Heart!) 🎙️

> Inspired by Jarvis, Siri, and Alexa — but with a personality twist! Meet **Hamster**, your friendly voice-controlled assistant built with empathy and creativity.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Hamster** is a personalized virtual assistant developed using Python, integrating **speech recognition**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **web automation**. While most assistants just "do the job", Hamster adds a **touch of warmth and friendliness**, making it feel like a companion rather than a command bot.

This project explores the idea of blending functionality with emotional intelligence — because sometimes, even tech should listen with heart.

---

## 🧠 Features

- 🎙️ **Voice Recognition:** Speak naturally — Hamster listens and understands your commands.
- 🌐 **Smart Automation:**
  - Opens websites like **YouTube**, **Google**, **LinkedIn**, etc.
  - Plays songs via voice commands (because sometimes, music heals).
  - Searches the web and performs basic assistant tasks.
- 💬 **Conversational Personality:** Hamster isn't just a tool — he responds like a companion.
- ❤️ **Emotionally-Aware UX:** Designed to simulate supportive, judgment-free listening.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- `speech_recognition` – for capturing and processing voice input
- `pyttsx3` – for voice responses
- `webbrowser` – for automating browser tasks
- `os` – to interact with system-level tasks

> *(Additional libraries may be added as the assistant evolves.)*

🎯 Goals & Vision
This version of Hamster is a starting point for something bigger:

Integrate advanced NLP for deeper understanding

Add emotion detection and sentiment-based responses

Connect with more APIs (Spotify, Weather, News)

Build a minimal GUI for non-terminal use

💡 Inspiration
"We often talk about AI as a tool — but what if it could also be a friend?"

This project was born from the idea that technology can be empathetic. Hamster is my first step toward building intelligent systems that don't just respond, but connect.
